#The Ultimate List of Software Developer Blogs

As far as I know, a “master list” of all the best software developer blogs does not exist. You can find small language specific lists, but nothing that contains a large quantity of different languages.

Since the Ultimate List of Developer Podcast’s seems to be so popular, I’ve decided to make a master list of all the best software developer blogs.

If you notice that something doesn’t quite fit or if there is an excellent resource that’s missing from the list, please contact me and I will make the appropriate changes.

If you have an excellent blog where you post up-to-date content on one of the subjects below, let me know in the comments below.

C#
